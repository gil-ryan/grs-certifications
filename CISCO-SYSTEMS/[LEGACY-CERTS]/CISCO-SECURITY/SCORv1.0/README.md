## TCP/IP Attacks

* ![__TCP Attacks__](https://github.com/gil-ryan/grs-networking-private/blob/master/SECURITY/CISCO-SECURITY/SCORv1.0/TCP_IP-ATTACKS/tcp-attacks.md)
* ![__UDP Attacks__](https://github.com/gil-ryan/grs-networking-private/blob/master/SECURITY/CISCO-SECURITY/SCORv1.0/TCP_IP-ATTACKSS/udp-attacks.md)

* Attack Surface and Attack Vector

An attack surface is the total sum of all vulnerabilities in a given computing device or network. Smaller attack surfaces can help make the organization less explotable, reducing risk. 

### Attack surfaces

Here are the examples

* __network attack surface__
* __software attack surface__
* __physical attack surface__
* __social engineering attack surface__

### Common threats

* __reconnaissance__
* __known vulnerabilities__
* __SQL injection__
* __phishing__
* __malware__
* __weak authentication__

## More Attacks

To be further classified later...

* __Reconnaissance Attacks__
* __Access Attacks__
* __MITM Attacks__
* __DoS and DDOS__
* __Reflection and Amplification__
* __Spoofing__
* __DHCP Attacks__
