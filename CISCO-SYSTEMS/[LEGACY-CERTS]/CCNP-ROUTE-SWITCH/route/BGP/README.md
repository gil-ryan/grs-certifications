# Border Gateway Protocol

BGP is the protocol of the Internet, and therefore massive. So for this I had to break it down into multiple sections and create a special folder for it. Below are the aspects of BGP we will be observing.

## Topics

* What is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
* Who needs BGP?
* Autonomous Systems
* Path Vector compared to Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP)
* Characteristics of BGP
    + Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

## 

* Routing tables
* Message Types
* Neighbor States
* Implementing BGP
    + eBGP & iBGP
* Transit AS vs. Non-Transit AS
* Neighbor relationships
    + eBGP & iBGP

## 

* Route Reflections
* Confederations
* Multi-Protocols BGP (MP-BPG)
* IPv4 and IPv6
    + v4 over v4
    + v4 over v6
    + v6 over v6
    + v6 over v4

## 

* Best Path Selection Algorithm
* Route filtering & Traffic Engineering
* eBGP multi-hop
* Securing BPG
* Soft reset and route refresh
* BGP Attributes
* Multipath

## 

* VRFs & BGP
* REGEX (Regular Expressions)
* Standard & Extended Communitites
* Peer Groups
* Peer Templates

## 

* BGP backdoor
* Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) origination
* Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
* Troubleshooting
* Wireshark for OSX
