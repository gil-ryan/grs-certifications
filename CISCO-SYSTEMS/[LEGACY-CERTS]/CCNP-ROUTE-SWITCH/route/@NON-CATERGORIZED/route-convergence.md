# Describing Routing Protocols - Convergence

## What is convergence

Convergence describes the prcoess in which routers notice a network change, exchange info about the change, and calculate to reevaluate the best route.

* converged network = normal state of autonomous system
* convergence time = how fast network devices reach the state of convergence after a network change

Convergence time describes how fast network devices can reach the state of convergence after a topology change. A fast convergence time minimizes downtime and lets devices quickly respond to network changes.

### Influence Convergence Time

* Fine-tune timers
* Route summarization

Different protocols, depending whether they're IGP of EGP, can influence how fast a network can converge.
